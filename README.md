# 🧪 Full-Stack Evaluator – Technical Exam Submission

Welcome to my submission for the technical evaluation!

This monorepo contains both the **backend (.NET 9 Web API)** and **frontend (React)** projects. I've built and fixed key parts of this intentionally incomplete system, addressing quirks and thinking like a dev in real-world scenarios.

---

## ⏱️ Time Limit

**4 to 5 hours**  
I treated this as a timed test, focusing on core functionality without overthinking peripherals.

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

- ✅ Connected the frontend to the existing API, handling partial data and errors.
- 🔧 Implemented or completed missing backend logic, such as [briefly list what you plan to or have done, e.g., EF Core interactions and API endpoints].
- 🔄 Managed real-world scenarios like incomplete data, API failures, and state management.
- 💅 Ensured code is clean, structured, and readable with comments where needed.
- 📦 Committed regularly to show my thought process — check the history!

## ✅ Submission Notes
- This is pushed to my public GitHub repo: https://github.com/LrgDv01/full-stack-evaluator
- What I implemented: [Add details here as you go, e.g., "Fixed API quirks in task endpoints, added error handling in React components."]
- What’s missing (if any): [e.g., "Advanced auth not implemented due to time; basic access control added."]
- How to test: 
  1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/LrgDv01/full-stack-evaluator.git`
  2. Set up backend: Navigate to `/backend`, run `dotnet ef database update`, then `dotnet run`.
  3. Set up frontend: Navigate to `/frontend`, run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
  4. Test API via Swagger at `http://localhost:5000/swagger`, and frontend at `http://localhost:5173`.

I built smart and coded loud. 💻🔥
